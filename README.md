Sometimes, TikToks or YouTube Shorts are uploaded in landscape format — easy to watch on a phone you can rotate, but awkward on a desktop or laptop where you can't flip your screen.

That's why this extension was created: to bring a comfortable viewing experience for every video, directly on your computer.

Picture-in-Picture Plus has evolved into a powerful everyday Picture-in-Picture tool, perfect for multitasking — meetings, gaming, studying, or simply watching your favorite content while browsing.

## ✨ Main Features

- 🌍 **Works on ALL sites** — YouTube, TikTok, Netflix, Twitch, Vimeo, and more
- 🔄 **Rotate horizontal videos on vertical feeds** — perfect for landscape TikToks, Shorts, and Reels
- 🧠 **Automatic detection** — recognizes when rotation is needed
- 🎮 **Custom shortcuts**: Toggle PiP (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and rotation (`Ctrl+Shift+E`)
- ⚙️ **Settings sync** — across all your Chrome devices
- 🪄 **Feed tracking** — PiP follows videos automatically when scrolling

## 💡 Why you'll love it

Unlike regular Picture-in-Picture tools, Picture-in-Picture Plus adapts to video orientation and fits your screen perfectly.

No more black bars, awkward layouts, or cropped content — just smooth, flexible viewing.

## 🧰 How to use

1. Open a website with video content
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `⌘⇧P` on Mac) to start Picture-in-Picture
3. For horizontal videos on vertical feeds, press `Ctrl+Shift+E` to rotate
4. Enjoy your floating, perfectly oriented video!
